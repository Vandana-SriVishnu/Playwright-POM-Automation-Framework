## 🧠 simple explanation:

> “I built a Playwright automation framework using TypeScript and Page Object Model.  
> I automated positive and negative login scenarios on SauceDemo, keeping UI locators and actions inside page classes and validations inside tests.  
> The framework is clean, reusable, and easy to extend.”
